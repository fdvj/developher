      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>First, focus on drawing your design on a page.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Once you've decided how you want it, start building the structure on your site with the tags we learned or new ones you found in the cheat sheet linked below.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When you're done, work on adding some coloring and fonts to your paper design. You can find some resources for inspiration and ideas on the links below.</p>
